# Haskell Club

The first rule of Haskell Club is that you don't talk about Haskell
Club.  Or at least, not more than, say, five times a day and for
longer than 30 minutes on each occasion.

We haven't decided on rules Two thru Seven

The eighth and final rule is: if it's your first time, you _have_ to
drive.
